 * A draft-mutation surface that can carry candidate-bound save advisory

 * Redeclaring `updateDraft()` with one trailing optional parameter is legal
 * interface widening: implementors of the base contract keep loading, and only
 * implementors that opt into this sub-interface must accept the receipts.
 * Callers must never assume support — route through
 * {@see SaveAdvisoryAcknowledgementDispatcher::updateDraft()}, which fails
 * closed rather than dropping receipts.
 *
 * Opting in is the only supported way to carry receipts: the base contract stays
 * frozen, and this extension is itself frozen at six parameters. A future
 * capability gets its own extending interface.
 *
